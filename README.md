# petro-utils

Welcome to **petro-utils** â€” a collection of helpful scripts, utilities, and resources designed to support users of the PetroCloud platform.

Whether you're debugging, automating a workflow, or exploring new features, this repo is meant to make your life a little easier. Each resource lives in its own directory and includes a `README.md` to explain its purpose, usage, and any relevant context.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

- Every utility or script is self-contained in its own folder.
- Each folder has a `README.md` with:
  - What the resource does
  - When and why you might use it
  - Instructions for setup and usage

This structure keeps things modular and easy to navigate â€” feel free to browse around or contribute something useful of your own.

## ðŸ“¬ Contributing
